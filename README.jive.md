# RasFLED: 
Lighting Up the Streets, Pi-style

Yo, peep this: RasFLED is on the block, bringin' you that multi-color light game straight to your Raspberry Pi. This computer's no joke, it's got mad skills to handle all sorts of control modules. Check it, the modules in this latest drop (2.021_230814) are tailor-made for a Raspberry Pi 3b, and we got four hot modules on deck.

### Module 1 - LED Swag and Switch Action:
Step up to Module 1, where LEDs pop and switches do their thang. This setup's reppin' for the rides, with each switch wired to them car doors. Crack open a door, and watch them overhead lights shine bright, throwin' out warnings too. Close 'em doors, lights out, just like that.

### Module 2 - Interface Vibes:
Slide into Module 2, an interface that's off the chain. Even in headless mode, hit that program with the -tty code and let the good times roll. It's all in the OpenGL system, givin' you mad access to them other modules and all the basics. You wanna set alerts, switch between day and night, flash them hazard lights, tweak colors? You got it, fam.

### Module 3 - Auto Scene:
Rollin' up on Module 3, where cars and code collide. Hit that Automobile tab if your ride's packin' a CAM bus reader through the OBD2 hookup. Run that custom Arduino magic, and boom, your car's stats be chillin' on the screen. Speed, acceleration, cruise control, tachometer, gears, temps, pressures, battery juice – you name it, it's there. Oh, and peep this: the auto module's throwin' down animations tied to speed and gears, takin' control of them door switches too. It's backup dance time if the CAM bus drops the beat.

### Module 4 - Sky High Signals:
Now we're on Module 4, where we're catchin' them vibes from the sky. I snagged a real-deal radio receiver and slapped an antenna on my whip's roof, and now I'm runnin' an ADS-B transponder reciever on wheels. Flight Aware's doin' its thing, and my interface's just kickin' back, peepin' them logs, showin' status on the ADSB tab. It's simple, stoppin' and startin' Flight Aware, maybe grabbin' a quick snapshot. But yo, I'm feelin' the code vibes, learnin' as I get that ADS-B info on the screen. Plus, watchin' them airplane blips up to a hunnid miles away on a radar screen? Keeps me rollin' on them long drives.

This here's RasFLED 2.0, the second round of this joint. Peep the OG version at https://github.com/briefnotion/RasFLED – it's still got game, fully capable, just kickin' it in a text console instead of that flashy OpenGL. Rasfled1's leaner on the CPU, can hit that remote SSH, but it was stuck with text graphs and a major buzzkill where a mouse click froze things up till the screen got its act together. Rasfled2's the real deal, though, flaunting that slick customizable interface, droppin' over ten colors, pixel by pixel control – that's the game-changer, right there.

Man, I'm in the zone, takin' a wild detour from that quick readme vibe. But yo, you get the deal, right? Rasfled2's the program, poppin' stuff on the dash, throwin' some pretty lights 'round town, all based on what's goin' down.
